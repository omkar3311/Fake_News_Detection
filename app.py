    st.session_state['text']="Federal health officials told the AP they have not received any reports of Ebola cases " \
    "at the Nevada event. A screenshot of a supposed post from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirming " \
    "such cases was fabricated. And there is no record of a national emergency being declared. The claims emerged after summe" \
    "r storm left muddy roads flooded, stranding tens of thousands of partygoers; event organizers let traffic flow out of the main " \
    "road Monday afternoon. ‚ÄúSo it was announced earlier that Burning Man was declared a national emergency because it was flooded," \
    " and so they sent in FEMA,‚Äù a woman claims in a TikTok video shared on Instagram, suggesting the development was suspicious. The" \
    " AP found no record, including on federal websites and in White House announcements, of a national emergency declaration and FEMA " \
    "confirmed that it was not involved in the situation. ‚ÄúNo FEMA personnel or assets have been deployed to the Burning Man festival" \
    " and there are no requests from local or state authorities for our assistance,‚Äù FEMA spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said in an email." \
    " The TikTok video, like other posts, goes on to relay baseless rumors of reported cases of Ebola, whose occasional outbreaks in " \
    "humans primarily occur in Africa, at the festival. Some posts also shared an image made to appear that the CDC confirmed the" \
    " supposed outbreak on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The purported X post from the agency reads, ‚ÄúEbola outbreak " \
    "confirmed at Black Rock City, NV. It is recommended that all Burning Man attendees remain in their dwellings until further notice." \
    " Current State of Emergency in progress.‚Äù But the CDC‚Äôs X account published no such post. ‚ÄúCDC has not received any reports of Ebola" \
    " at the Burning Man Festival and has not issued any warnings or had any requests for assistance from the state and local health " \
    "departments either,‚Äù agency spokesperson Scott Pauley said in an email. Reverse image searches further show that a graphic about" \
    " Ebola used in the fictitious CDC post was published by the agency in 2016, but elements of it were changed. For example, " \
    "the original graphic asks, ‚ÄúRecently in West Africa?‚Äù But the version used in the made-up X post asks, ‚ÄúRecently in Nevada?‚Äù " \
    "Referencing more online rumors, Pauley also noted the CDC had not received reports of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, " \
    "or Marburg, a rare but severe hemorrhagic fever, in relation to Burning Man. A representative for the Burning Man Project " \
    "organization also refuted the online claims. ‚ÄúQuite simply, the online rumors of transmissible illnesses in Black Rock City" \
    " are unfounded and untrue,‚Äù Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley said in an email. The festival had been closed to vehicles after more " \
    "than a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain fell Sept. 1, causing flooding and foot-deep mud, as the AP reported. The annual " \
    "gathering, which launched on a San Francisco beach in 1986, attracts nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists for a mix " \
    "of wilderness camping and avant-garde performances"
